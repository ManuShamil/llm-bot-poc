# FAQ

## Where did my 3ULL go?

Your tokens haven't disappeared, they have been migrated from the Avalanche C-Chain to the new PLAYA3ULL GAMES Mainnet. They are now referred to as 3ULL coins directly on our new Mainnet. If you can't see them in your wallet, make sure your wallet is correctly connected to the PLAYA3ULL GAMES Mainnet. (Do not get this confused with w3ULL).
