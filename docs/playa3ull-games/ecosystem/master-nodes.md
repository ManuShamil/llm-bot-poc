# ðŸŸ© Master Nodes

The Master Node Network is a fundamental component of the PLAYA3ULL GAMES ecosystem, providing critical infrastructure for decentralized blockchain indexing, querying, and IPFS storage. It ensures secure and efficient access to the network, enabling games to query the blockchain quickly.

## Uptime Requirements

**You currently do not need to run the Master Node Software.**

As a Master Node License owner, you play a crucial role in the operation of the PLAYA3ULL GAMES ecosystem. The following are some important considerations and requirements regarding uptime for your Master Node:

1. **Node Activation**: You will be required to download and activate the Node Software on a single computer. The power of the computer isn't a primary concern at this stage.
2. **Multiple Master Nodes**: If you own more than one Master Node License, you can activate the Node Software on a single computer. Despite the number of Master Nodes being activated from a single machine, you will still receive rewards for each Master Node License associated with your Wallet.
3. **Uptime Requirement**: A minimum uptime of 8 hours per day is estimated for each Master Node. Maintaining this uptime is essential as it ensures the smooth functioning of the network.
4. <mark style="color:red;">**Impact of Downtime**</mark><mark style="color:red;">:</mark> Failure to meet the uptime requirement could result in forfeiture of your node/s rewards. These would then be redistributed to other node owners who are maintaining the necessary uptime.

It's essential to meet these requirements to ensure the efficient operation of the Master Node Network and to continue receiving the rewards associated with your Master Node Licenses.

## Master Node Tokenomics

The network is designed to comprise 50,000 nodes, each being a vital element in the ecosystem's functionality and security. With a total of 50 billion 3ULL coins on the [PLAYA3ULL GAMES Blockchain](avalanche-subnet/).

The network releases 13,698,630 3ULL coins per day, with 50% divided equally among the node owners and the remaining 50% allocated to the company for operations. The company uses its share to fund overall operations, purchase games, and support ongoing game development. As the number of nodes increases, the number of coins that Node Owners receive decreases proportionally.

Additionally, the Master Node Network has a dynamic pricing system for the nodes. The initial 100 nodes are priced at $100 each, and the price increases by $100 for each subsequent set of 100 nodes sold.

Once all coins are distributed, Node Owners receive a small fee for each transaction in exchange for hosting the nodes. This approach ensures that the network continues to be self-sustaining even after the initial coin distribution is complete. The fee's from the blockchain are currently being accumulated, to extend the 3ULL rewards once we have minted all coins.

## Services

### **Decentralized Blockchain Indexing**

Master nodes maintain and manage the blockchain ledger, ensuring the indexing of all transactions. This function helps to maintain an accurate record of all transactions and data stored on the blockchain, allowing efficient data retrieval and verification when needed.

### **Blockchain Querying**

Master nodes enable fast, efficient querying of the blockchain. This allows games and users to interact with the blockchain, executing transactions and accessing data at high speed, ensuring a smooth gaming experience.

### **IPFS Storage**

Master nodes also provide InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage, a peer-to-peer decentralized network. It is primarily used for storing NFT metadata and image data. This ensures secure, distributed storage and access to key digital assets in the ecosystem.
