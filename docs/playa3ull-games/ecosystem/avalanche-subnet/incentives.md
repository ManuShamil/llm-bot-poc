# Incentives

## Incentives

Currently, our incentive model for validators is quite primitive and subject to change and discussion with our validation network.

At present, we are allocating 100,000 _$3ULL_ each day, divided by the number of external validators

As at 15/05/2023 there are 5 external validators, which yield a total of 20,000 _3ULL_ per node per day.

These incentives may change at anytime, in consultation with our validator partners
{% endhint %}
