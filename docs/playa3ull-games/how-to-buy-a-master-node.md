# ðŸŽ® How to buy a Master Node

Purchasing a node on PLAYA3ULL GAMES is a straightforward process that can be completed in a few simple steps. This guide will help you understand how to carry out this process.

## Prerequisites:

Ensure you have a MetaMask wallet installed and set up with enough funds for the transaction.

## Step 1: Select Payment Method (Token / Network)

To begin, you will need to select the token or network you wish to use for the purchase. This can be found on the [nodes page](https://app.playa3ull.games/nodes).

## Step 2: Swap to the Selected Network

MetaMask will automatically detect the network you have selected and will prompt you to swap to that network if you're not already connected to it. To proceed, approve the network swap when the prompt appears.

## Step 3: Approve the Transaction

Once you have selected your token and are connected to the correct network, you will then need to approve the transaction. The approval process varies depending on the token you're using for the purchase.

### **If you are purchasing with 3ULL:**

If you're purchasing with 3ULL, the approval process will only take a few moments. Once the transaction has been approved, your new node should appear in your account shortly.

### **If you are purchasing with another token (such as Avalanche with USDC):**

If you're purchasing with another token like USDC on the Avalanche network, the approval process may take a bit longer. This is because PLAYA3ULL GAMES needs to perform some background processes to convert your tokens into nodes.

Please be patient during this time, as it can take several minutes to complete the transaction.
