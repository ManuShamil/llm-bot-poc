### Using Your Wallet Provider

Connecting to the PLAYA3ULL GAMES dApp is extremely simple, aided by the inherent security of the blockchain, it's as easy as clicking a button and authorising the connection.

In the top-right corner of the dApp, you will see a person icon, clicking this displays the list of wallet providers we support, as shown below. You can view planned providers to be implemented over at [#planned-wallet-support](connecting-your-wallet.md#planned-wallet-support "mention").&#x20;

Select a wallet provider from the list, and a popup to sign the transaction will appear in your wallet.&#x20;

Approving the sign-in message will connect your wallet to the dApp, and retrieve all relevant information associated with that wallet. No passwords, no emails, just a single secure authentication method for everything.

And that's it! Feel free to take a look around the dApp, and when you're ready, check out the [my-account](my-account/ "mention") page.
