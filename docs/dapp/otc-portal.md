The PLAYA3ULL GAMES OTC Portal allows you to view your active and historical OTC deals that you have made. Here you can see details about each of your schedules including their start and end time, the total amount, and how much you have released so far.

Once your OTC schedule has unlocked, you can claim the amounts directly within the portal.
