Your account settings tab provides you access with a suite of options to fine tune your account, as well as provide additional access to other parts of the PLAYA3ULL GAMES ecosystem. Let's go through each tab one by one.

### üí° Details

The account details tab allows you to set a display name on the dApp. This name will be tied to your wallet, and could be used in place of your wallet address for services such as the Marketplace.

### ‚úâÔ∏è Notifications

The notifications tab shows all your notifications in a more expanded format than what the notification button in the navigation bar provides. You can also configure what type of notifications you will receive, as well as the email notifications if you have connected an email to your account.

### üåê Connected Accounts

You can expand your experience throughout the PLAYA3ULL GAMES ecosystem by connecting various external accounts to your wallet. Some benefits of doing this are as follows:

* Receive newsletters about new games and features straight to your email
* Get exclusive and unique roles in Discord
* Look at in-game stats for the various games you have played
* Earn badges in the dApp for completing your profile

### üì∑ KYC

{% hint style="warning" %}
The KYC verification process is optional, and only required if you wish to purchase NFTs with credit card
{% endhint %}

In order to comply with anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering regulations, PLAYA3ULL GAMES requires users to complete the KYC verification process before allowing purchases with credit card.

The steps to completing the KYC process are extremely simple to complete. Just click the "Start Verification Process" button, and follow the couple of steps to complete the process.

Once complete, you can start purchasing NFTs with a credit card.

### üí≥ Billing

In order to make the blockchain more accessible as many users, as well as providing the ability for users versed in Web3, PLAYA3ULL GAMES offers multiple ways of purchasing products across the ecosystem. As usual, you can purchase products such as NFTs with 3ULL, or for those who do not have any 3ULL, or wish to purchase with other means, you can use a credit card to complete purchases.

In order to add and use a credit card on the PLAYA3ULL GAMES platform, you are required to have the following:

* Email address linked to your wallet and verified (see [#connected-accounts](settings.md#connected-accounts "mention"))
* KYC verification process completed and verified (see [#kyc](settings.md#kyc "mention"))

Once both are completed, you can add a new card to use.

#### Adding a credit card

Initially, you will not have any cards added to your account, so let's add one! Click the "+" button next to **Payment Methods** to display the form below:

As you can see, the required fields are the standard fields that you would see on most sites across the internet for adding a new card.

Credit card transactions, including the verification of credit cards, are managed by Circle Internet Financial LLC (USDC/EROC); PLAYA3ULL GAMES and its subsidiaries or affiliates do not retain any sensitive data.

Once completing the form and pressing the "Add Card" button, you will see the card under your payment methods:&#x20;
