The PLAYA3ULL GAMES dApp account page is where you will find your balance of 3ULL, your nodes, the number of rewards released per node, as well as where you can claim rewards produced by your nodes.

Hold on, claiming? Nodes? What's all this stuff? A PLAYA3ULL GAMES Master Node, as they're officially called, is one of the core pillars of the PLAYA3ULL GAMES blockchain. Check out the full write-up and explanation over at [ecosystem](../../playa3ull-games/ecosystem/ "mention") and [master-nodes.md](../../playa3ull-games/ecosystem/master-nodes.md "mention").&#x20;

You can claim the node rewards earnt whenever you like, if you don't claim immediately, don't fret, they will continue to accrue over time, meaning you can let them sit there and go to work, and check back in on them from time to time.
